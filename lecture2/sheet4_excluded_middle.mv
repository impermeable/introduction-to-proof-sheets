The law of excluded middle may be useful to prove some statements that are unprovable without it.
To use the law of excluded middle, you can either use `Either [statement] or [statement]` immediately, or first use `It holds that [statement] âˆ¨ Â¬[statement]` and then use `Either [statement] or Â¬[statement]`.

```coq
Example example_1_1_64 (p q : Prop) : Â¬(p âˆ§ q) â‡’ Â¬p âˆ¨ Â¬q.
Proof.
Assume that Â¬(p âˆ§ q).
Either p or Â¬p.
- Case p.
  Either q or Â¬q.
-- Case q.
   It holds that p âˆ§ q.
   Contradiction.
-- Case Â¬q.
   We conclude that Â¬p âˆ¨ Â¬q.
- Case Â¬p.
  We conclude that Â¬p âˆ¨ Â¬q.
Qed.
```

There is an exercise below where the law of excluded middle is necessary.

```coq
Lemma exercise_1_1_67 (p q : Prop) : 
  (Â¬q â‡’ Â¬p) â‡’ p â‡’ q.
Proof.

Proposition 1.1.65 is an example of use of the law of the excluded middle.

```coq
Lemma proposition1_1_65 (a b : â„¤) : 
  (a*b) is even â‡’ a is even âˆ¨ b is even.
Proof.
Assume that (a*b) is even.
Either a is even or a is odd.
- Case a is even.
  We conclude that a is even âˆ¨ b is even.
- Case a is odd.
  Either b is even or b is odd.
-- Case b is even.
   We conclude that a is even âˆ¨ b is even.
-- Case b is odd.
  We argue by contradiction.
  Assume that Â¬(a is even âˆ¨ b is even).
  It holds that âˆƒk âˆˆ â„¤, a = 2*k+1.
  Obtain such k.
  It holds that 2*k+1 = a.
  It holds that âˆƒl âˆˆ â„¤, b = 2*l+1.
  Obtain such l.
  It holds that 2*l+1 = b.
  It holds that a * b = (2*k+1)*(2*l+1).
  It holds that (2*k+1)*(2*l+1) = 4*k*l+2*k+2*l+1.
  It holds that 4*k*l+2*k+2*l+1 = 2*(2*k*l + k + l) + 1.
  It holds that 2*(2*k*l + k + l) + 1 = a*b.
  It holds that (a*b) is odd.
  It holds that (a*b) is even âˆ§ (a*b) is odd.
  Contradiction.
Qed.
