To prove statements using unions (∪) can be done in Waterproof using `It holds that ...`, `It suffices to show that ...` and `We conclude that ...`.
All of these use the following equivalence.

$x ∈ A ∪ B ↔ x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B$

Note this is similar to intersection, but instead of conjunctions (and), it uses disjunctions (or).
Below are exercises using unions.

## Example 2.2.22

```coq
Example example_2_2_22 (X Y W : subset 𝒰) : 
  X ∩ (Y ∪ W) = (X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W).
Proof.
It suffices to show that X ∩ (Y ∪ W) ⊆ ((X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W)) 
  ∧ (X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W) ⊆ (X ∩ (Y ∪ W)).
We show both statements.
- We need to show that X ∩ (Y ∪ W) ⊆ ((X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W)).
  It suffices to show ∀ a ∈ (X ∩ (Y ∪ W)), a ∈ ((X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W)).
  Take a ∈ X ∩ (Y ∪ W).
  It holds that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y ∪ W.
  It holds that a ∈ Y ∨ a ∈ W.
  Either a ∈ Y or a ∈ W.
  + Case a ∈ Y.
    It suffices to show a ∈ X ∩ Y ∨ a ∈ X ∩ W.
    It suffices to show a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y.
    We conclude that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y.
  + Case a ∈ W.
    It suffices to show a ∈ X ∩ Y ∨ a ∈ X ∩ W.
    It suffices to show a ∈ X ∩ W.
    It suffices to show a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ W.
    We conclude that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ W.
- We need to show that (X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W) ⊆ (X ∩ (Y ∪ W)).
  It suffices to show ∀ a ∈ (X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W), a ∈ (X ∩ (Y ∪ W)).
  Take a ∈ (X ∩ Y) ∪ (X ∩ W).
  It suffices to show a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y ∪ W.
  It holds that a ∈ X ∩ Y ∨ a ∈ X ∩ W.
  Either a ∈ X ∩ Y or a ∈ X ∩ W.
  + Case a ∈ (X ∩ Y).
    It holds that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y. 
    It holds that a ∈ X.
    It holds that a ∈ Y ∨ a ∈ W.
    It holds that a ∈ Y ∪ W.
    We conclude that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y ∪ W.
  + Case a ∈ (X ∩ W).
    It holds that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ W. 
    It holds that a ∈ X.
    It holds that a ∈ Y ∨ a ∈ W.
    It holds that a ∈ Y ∪ W.
    We conclude that a ∈ X ∧ a ∈ Y ∪ W.
