This exercise sheet is for Section 2.2 Set Operations from the book Infinite Descent into Mathematics.
First, we will prove statements involving the intersection operation (∩).
Waterproof can unfold `a ∈ X ∩ Y` using `It holds that ...`, `It suffices to show that ...`, and `We conclude that ...`.
Below is an example.

## Example 2.2.2

<hint title="📦 Technical details">
```coq
Open Scope R2_scope.

</hint>

```coq
Example example_2_2_3 (x : ℝ) : 
  x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ ↔ x ∈ [0, ∞) ∧ x ∈ ℚ.
Proof.
We show both directions.
- We need to show that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ ⇒ x ∈ [0, ∞) ∧ x ∈ ℚ.
  Assume that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ.
  We conclude that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∧ x ∈ ℚ.
- We need to show that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∧ x ∈ ℚ ⇒ x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ.
  Assume that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∧ x ∈ ℚ.
  We conclude that x ∈ [0, ∞) ∩ ℚ.
Qed.

Before doing an exercise, it helps to understand how to prove that a set is an interval in Waterproof.
This is done by using `It suffices to show that ...`.
In the following line, you choose the interval you want to show it is equal to.
To illustrate this, a proof is started below.

## Interval Example

```coq
Lemma is_interval_example : 
  [0,2] ∩ [0,1] is a single interval.
Proof.
It suffices to show that [0, 2] ∩ [0, 1] = [0, 1].
Abort.
```

The following exercise is to practice with intersections (∩).

## Exercise 2.2.6

```coq
Lemma exercise_2_2_6 : [-2, 5) ∩ [4, 7) is a single interval.
Proof.

Below there is another example of a proof with intersection.

## Proposition 2.2.7

```coq
Lemma proposition_2_2_7 (X Y : subset 𝒰) : 
  X ⊆ Y ↔ X ∩ Y = X.
Proof.
We show both directions.
- We need to show that X ⊆ Y ⇨ X ∩ Y = X.
  Assume that X ⊆ Y.
  It holds that ∀ x ∈ X, x ∈ Y as (i).
  It suffices to show that X ∩ Y ⊆ X ∧ X ⊆ (X ∩ Y).
  We show both statements.
  + We need to show that (X ∩ Y) ⊆ X.
    It suffices to show that ∀ x ∈ X ∩ Y, x ∈ X.
    Take x ∈ X ∩ Y.
    It holds that x ∈ X ∧ x ∈ Y.
    We conclude that x ∈ X.
  + We need to show that X ⊆ (X ∩ Y).
    It suffices to show that ∀ x ∈ X, x ∈ X ∩ Y.
    Take x ∈ X.
    It suffices to show that x ∈ X ∧ x ∈ Y.
    We show both statements.
    We conclude that x ∈ X.
    We need to show that x ∈ Y.
    By (i) we conclude that x ∈ Y.
- We need to show that X ∩ Y = X ⇒ X ⊆ Y.
  Assume that X ∩ Y = X.
  It suffices to show that ∀ x ∈ X, x ∈ Y.
  Take x ∈ X.
  It holds that x ∈ X ∩ Y.
  It holds that x ∈ X ∧ x ∈ Y.
  We conclude that x ∈ Y.

To show that two sets `A` and `B` are disjoint in Waterproof, use `It suffices to show that A ∩ B is empty`.
This can then be unfolded using the definition from Section 2.1.

## Example 2.2.10

Below is a slightly adapted version of Example 2.2.10 to make
the proof less verbose.

```coq
Lemma example_2_2_10 : {0, 2} is disjoint from {1, 3}.
Proof.
It suffices to show that {0, 2} ∩ {1, 3} is empty.
It suffices to show that ∀ x ∈ {0,2} ∩ {1,3}, False.
Take x ∈ {0, 2} ∩ {1, 3}.
It holds that x ∈ {0,2} ∧ x ∈ {1, 3}.
It holds that x ∈ {0,2}.
Either x = 0 or x = 2.
- Case x = 0.
  It holds that x ∉ {1, 3}.
  Contradiction.
- Case x = 2.
  It holds that x ∉ {1, 3}.
  Contradiction.
Qed.
