## Example 3.1.39

This example shows the interaction between image and preimage.

```coq
Example example_3_1_39 (f : X → Y) (U : subset X) (V : subset Y) :
    (f[U] ⊆ V) ↔ (U ⊆ f⁻¹[V]).
Proof.
We show both directions.
+ We need to show that f [ U ] ⊆ V ⇨ U ⊆ f⁻¹[V].
  Assume that f[U] ⊆ V as (i).
  It suffices to show ∀ x ∈ U, x ∈ f⁻¹[V].
  Take x ∈ U.
  It holds that f(x) ∈ f[U].
  By (i) it holds that ∀ x ∈ f[U], x ∈ V.
  It holds that f(x) ∈ V.
  We conclude that x ∈ f⁻¹[V].
+ We need to show that (U ⊆ f⁻¹[V]) ⇨ f [U] ⊆ V.
  Assume that U ⊆ f⁻¹[V].
  It suffices to show ∀ y ∈ f[U], y ∈ V.
  Take y ∈ f[U].
  It holds that ∃ x ∈ U, y = f(x).
  Obtain such an x.
  It holds that ∀ x ∈ U, x ∈ f⁻¹[V].
  It holds that x ∈ f⁻¹[V].
  It holds that f(x) ∈ V.
  We conclude that y ∈ V.
