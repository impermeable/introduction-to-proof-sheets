## Example 3.1.35

```coq
Example example_3_1_35 (g : X → Y) (U V : subset X) :
  g[U ∩ V] ⊆ g[U] ∩ g[V].
Proof.
It suffices to show that ∀ y ∈ g[U ∩ V], y ∈ g[U] ∩ g[V].
Take y ∈ g[U ∩ V].
It holds that ∃ x ∈ (U ∩ V), y = g x.
Obtain such an x.
It holds that x ∈ U ∧ x ∈ V.
It suffices to show that y ∈ g[U] ∧ y ∈ g[V].
We show both statements.
- We need to show that y ∈ g[U].
  It suffices to show that ∃ z : X, In X U z ∧ y = g z.
  Choose z := x.
  We conclude that In X U z ∧ y = g z.
- We need to show that y ∈ g[V].
  It suffices to show that ∃ w : X, In X V w ∧ y = g w.
  Choose w := x.
  We conclude that In X V w ∧ y = g w.
Qed.

## Exercise 3.1.36

Due to technicalities, if the statement is false, 
it is hard to prove the correctness of the counterexample in Waterproof.
If the statement is true, you can simply prove it as usual. However, note that not all three parts of this exercise need to be provable.

### Part (a): g[U] ∩ g[V] ⊆ g[U ∩ V]

```coq
Lemma exercise_3_1_36a_true (g : X → Y) (U V : subset X) :
  g[U] ∩ g[V] ⊆ g[U ∩ V].
Proof.

### Part (b): g[U ∪ V] ⊆ g[U] ∪ g[V]

  g[U ∪ V] ⊆ g[U] ∪ g[V].
