This exercise sheet is for Section 2.1 Sets from the book Infinite Descent into Mathematics.
Before starting this exercise sheet, first read and complete the exercises from the book up to the section on subsets.
Some exercises in the book ask for set builder notation or specific elements of certain sets; these types of questions are not included in this sheet.
This sheet only contains questions that ask you to prove a statement.

The example below shows how you can unfold a definition.
This is done by using `It suffices to show that ...` or `We need to show that ...` if the definition is in the goal.
In this case, it unfolds the definition of ⊆ (subset).

```coq
Example example_2_1_8 (X : subset 𝒰) : X ⊆ X.
Proof.
We need to show that ∀ x ∈ X, x ∈ X.
Take x ∈ X.
We conclude that x ∈ X.
Qed.
```

Below is another example of unfolding the definition of ⊆ in the goal.

```coq
Example example_2_1_9 (a b c d : ℝ) :
    a < c → c < d → d < b → [c, d] ⊆ (a, b).
Proof.
Assume that a < c, c < d and d < b.
We need to show that ∀ x ∈ [c, d], x ∈ (a, b).
Take x ∈ [c, d].
It holds that & a < c ≤ x.
It holds that & x ≤ d < b.
We conclude that x ∈ (a, b).
Qed.
```

Below is an exercise on working with subsets.

```coq
Lemma exercise_2_1_10 (a b c d : ℝ) :
    a < b → c < d → [a,b) ⊆ (c, d] ↔ a > c ∧ b ≤ d.
Proof.

Below is another example, but here the subset definition is also unfolded while it is in the assumption.
This is done by using `It holds that ...`.

```coq
Example proposition_2_1_12 (X Y W : subset 𝒰)
    : X ⊆ Y ⇒ Y ⊆ W ⇒ X ⊆ W.
Proof.
Assume that X ⊆ Y.
It holds that ∀ a ∈ X, a ∈ Y as (i).

Assume that Y ⊆ W.
It holds that ∀ a ∈ Y, a ∈ W as (ii).

We need to show ∀ a ∈ X, a ∈ W.
Take a ∈ X.

We need to show a ∈ W.
By (i) it holds that a ∈ Y.
By (ii) we conclude that a ∈ W.
Qed.
