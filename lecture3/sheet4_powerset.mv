Example example_2_1_8 (X : subset 𝒰) : X ⊆ X.
Proof.
We need to show that ∀ x ∈ X, x ∈ X.
Take x ∈ X.
We conclude that x ∈ X.

In Waterproof, the powerset of `X` is denoted as `𝒫(X)`, and `A ∈ 𝒫(X)` is by definition equivalent to `A ⊆ X`.
From this, you can use `It suffices to show that ...` or `We conclude that ...` if the statement `A ∈ 𝒫(X)` is in the goal, and you can use `It holds that ...` or `We conclude that ...` if the statement `A ∈ 𝒫(X)` is in the assumptions.
In both cases, Waterproof will automatically use the definition of the power set to complete the proof step.
Below are two examples.

```coq
Lemma definition2_1_28_example (X Y : subset 𝒰): X ⊆ Y ⇔ X ∈ 𝒫(Y).
Proof.
We show both directions.
- We need to show that X ⊆ Y ⇨ X ∈ 𝒫(Y).
  Assume that X ⊆ Y.
  We conclude that X ∈ 𝒫(Y).
- We need to show that X ∈ 𝒫(Y) ⇨ X ⊆ Y.
  Assume that X ∈ 𝒫(Y).
  We conclude that X ⊆ Y. 
Qed.
```
Below are several exercises on powersets.
